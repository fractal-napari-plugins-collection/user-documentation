HDF5 Reader
-----------------------------------------

The HDF5 file format is an open source file format that supports large, complex, heterogeneous data. HDF5 uses a "file directory" like structure that allows you to organize data within the file in many different structured ways, as you might do with files on your computer.


HDF5 Reader is a dock widget, which makes it easy to visualize data wrapped into hdf5 file format. It opens a dialog window to select the .hdf5 file and then gives the possibility to choose the data by a dropdown menu.
